# Marketing for Thulani's library

* Taurus@ThulaniLib is a website advertising My Library that has just opened doors to everyone to read feely.
* The reason for choosing this name is **Thulani** means "Be Silent" and a library is Quiet place.
* The webpage consists of:
   * Navigation bar with a logo
   * A picture showing the interior design of the library.(the intention is to showcase the comfortability and coziness providing a suitable space to indulge in the book.)
   * A heading that tells you what we promise to deliver to you as a _dear gentle reader_ or a guest in our library
   * Hyperlinked buttons though no links were added for referencing, because i could not find  suitable websites to link to mine...
   * Icons extracted from the React-icons library of which I used to invite viewers to follow us on social-media platforms.
   * A footer that is similar to the logo.
#### **Problems encountered: **
   + At first I could not use the tailwindcss utility classes or rather tailwind in all because i had made an error when installing it in my React app, and trying to fix it made thingd worse, so I decided to start afresh.
   + Applying the tailwindcss utility classes became a bit of a problem I sometimes added the traditional CSS classes, but thanks to double-chaecking I could spot them, erase them and use the tailwindcss utility classes.
   + The reason for adding the same logo and footer is because the responsivess of my webpage has some issues, on small screens the logo doesnot appear so I used the footer as an alternative for now as I work on fixing the issue.
#### **What I learned**
_I learned a lot._
**Firstly,** I learned how to install tailwindcss, how to import and configure it.
- I also learned how to use its classes for styling webpages 
- I learned how to install react-icons, how to import them and how to style them using tailwindcss.
**I only used tailwindcss for styling**
