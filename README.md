* The reason for choosing this name is **Thulani** means "Be Silent" and a library is Quiet place.
* The webpage consists of:
* Navigation bar with a logo
* A picture showing the interior design of the library.(the intention is to showcase the comfortability and coziness providing a suitable space to indulge in the book.)
